Hello Folks,

We hope you've enjoyed the {{name}} Workshop in the {{color}} series.

Here are some useful links to help you re-visit the material:

1. The  Github Repository with the jupyter notebooks and the data:[https://github.com/univai-ghf/{{repo}}](https://github.com/univai-ghf/{{repo}}). The documentation on that page has links to the Colab Notebooks for this workshop.
2. You can download the entire repository as a zip file from[https://github.com/univai-ghf/{{repo}}/archive/refs/heads/main.zip](https://github.com/univai-ghf/{{repo}}/archive/refs/heads/main.zip).
3. We discuss the workshops and their homework on our [community forum](https://discourse.univ.ai). If you would like to work through it again, [here](https://colab.research.google.com/github/univai-ghf/{{repo}}/blob/main/{{main_notebook_file}}) is the Colab link to the [main notebook](https://github.com/univai-ghf/{{repo}}/blob/main/{{main_notebook_file}}) for the workshop. If you have questions about the material, or questions on {{name}} in general, please ask on [this]({{thread_main}}) thread.
4. Our workshops have homework. This is a great way to re-inforce what you learned in the workshop. It will take an hour to two to do, including reading the homework text. If you'd like to get a certificate for this workshop, you must do the homework. The [homework notebook](https://github.com/univai-ghf/{{repo}}/blob/main/{{homework_notebook_file}}) can be accessed from the github repository. Or you can directly access it on Colab [here](https://colab.research.google.com/github/univai-ghf/{{repo}}/blob/main/{{homework_notebook_file}}).
5. The homework is not a competition and you can work with your peers on doing it, though you must submit your own notebook. We discuss the homework on this [thread]({{thread_homework}}) on the forum. The homework submission form is linked in the first post on that thread. The deadline for submission is Sunday {{submission_date}} at 11.59PM IST. After completing your homework, attempt the quiz questions present in the Google Form and upload your homework solution notebook (the extension of the notebook must be .ipynb). Certificates will be only issued to participants who attempt the quiz and submi the homework solution notebook.



We are looking forward to answering your questions and seeing your homework results!
