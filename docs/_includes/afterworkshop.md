Hello Folks,

We hope you've enjoyed the {{page.wsname}} Workshop in the {{page.color}} series.

Here are some useful links to help you re-visit the material:

1. The  Github Repository with the jupyter notebooks and the data: [https://github.com/univai-ghf/{{page.repo}}](https://github.com/univai-ghf/{{page.repo}}). The documentation on that page has links to the Colab Notebooks for this workshop.
2. You can download the entire repository as a zip file from [https://github.com/univai-ghf/{{page.repo}}/archive/refs/heads/main.zip](https://github.com/univai-ghf/{{page.repo}}/archive/refs/heads/main.zip).
3. We discuss the workshops and their homework on our [community forum](https://discourse.univ.ai). If you would like to work through this workshop again, [here](https://colab.research.google.com/github/univai-ghf/{{page.repo}}/blob/main/{{page.main_notebook_file}}) is the Colab link to the [main notebook](https://github.com/univai-ghf/{{page.repo}}/blob/main/{{page.main_notebook_file}}) for the workshop. If you have questions about the material, or questions on {{page.topic}} in general, please ask on [this]({{page.thread_main}}) thread.
4. Doing the assigned homework is a great way to re-inforce what you learned in the workshop. It will take an hour or two of your time. The [homework notebook](https://github.com/univai-ghf/{{page.repo}}/blob/main/{{page.homework_notebook_file}}) can be accessed from the github repository. Or you can directly access it on Colab [here](https://colab.research.google.com/github/univai-ghf/{{page.repo}}/blob/main/{{page.homework_notebook_file}}). The homework is not a competition and you can collaborate with your peers on it, **though you must submit your own notebook**. We discuss the homework on this [thread]({{page.thread_homework}}) on the forum. The **homework submission form is linked in the first post on that thread**. The deadline for submission is  {{page.submission_date}} at 11.59PM IST. 
5. If youâ€™d like to get a **certificate** for this workshop, you **must** attempt the quiz questions in the Google Form **and** upload your homework solution notebook (the extension of which must be .ipynb). 

We are looking forward to answering your questions and seeing your homework results!

The next workshop in the {{page.color}} series is [{{page.next_workshop_name}}]({{page.next_workshop_link}}) (click the link to register) on {{page.next_workshop_date}}. Our entire current series of data science workshops is below. You can take any workshop as many times as you want; so if you feel you need to do any workshop again, just take it in another color series.
