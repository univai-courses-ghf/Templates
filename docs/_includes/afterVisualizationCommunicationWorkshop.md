4. There is a homework that we would love for you to try. It's essentially a bunch of **Quiz** questions. We discuss the homework on this [thread]({{page.thread_homework}}) on the forum. The **homework submission form is linked in the first post on that thread**. The deadline for submission is  {{page.submission_date}} at 11.59PM IST. 
5. If youâ€™d like to get a **certificate** for this workshop, you **must** attempt the quiz questions in the Google Form. 

We are looking forward to answering your questions and seeing your homework results!<br>

We would love to know your feedback and your suggestions of topics that you want us to cover in our future workshops and we will try and incorporate it in our next iteration of Operational Skills Series. You can do so on this [thread]({{page.thread_suggestion}}) on the forum.
