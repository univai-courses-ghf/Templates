Hello Folks,<br>

We hope you've enjoyed the {{page.wsname}} Workshop in the {{page.color}} series.<br>

Here are some useful links to help you re-visit the material:

1. The  Github Repository with all the resources: [https://github.com/univai-ghf/{{page.repo}}](https://github.com/univai-ghf/{{page.repo}}).
2. You can download the entire repository as a zip file from [https://github.com/univai-ghf/{{page.repo}}/archive/refs/heads/main.zip](https://github.com/univai-ghf/{{page.repo}}/archive/refs/heads/main.zip).
3. We discuss the workshops and their homework on our [community forum](https://discourse.univ.ai). If you would like to work through this workshop again, [here](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/univai-ghf/GitAndHubWorkshop/HEAD) is the Virtual Environment link hosted on [MyBinder.org](https://mybinder.org/) and [here](https://github.com/univai-ghf/GitAndHubWorkshop/raw/main/git.pdf) is the link to the presentation with all the instructions to practice and replicate the scenarios that you learnt during the course of the workshop. If you have questions about the material, or questions on {{page.topic}} in general, please ask on [this]({{page.thread_main}}) thread.
4. There is a homework that we would love for you to try. It's essentially a bunch of **Quiz** questions. We discuss the homework on this [thread]({{page.thread_homework}}) on the forum. The **homework submission form is linked in the first post on that thread**. The deadline for submission is  {{page.submission_date}} at 11.59PM IST. 
5. If youâ€™d like to get a **certificate** for this workshop, you **must** attempt the quiz questions in the Google Form. 

We are looking forward to answering your questions and seeing your homework results!<br>
